Hi! I'm a second-year graduate student in the Mechanical Engineering - Research program at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), and a Belgian American Educational Foundation ([BAEF](https://baef.be/)) scholar.

Advised by Pr. [Zac Manchester](https://rexlab.ri.cmu.edu/) and Pr. [Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/), my current research focuses on real-time optimization-based planning and control for agile autonomous spacecraft in rendezvous and proximity operations. Additionally, I develop and test guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems, simulations, and flight software for CubeSat missions.

Previously, I graduated with a B.S. in Electromechanical Engineering from [Universit√© libre de Bruxelles](https://www.ulb.be/en) (Belgium) in 2022. My undergraduate research was centered on the development and testing of new sensors and actuators, and the subsequent control for minimally invasive endoscopic and surgical tools, as well as on local model-order reduction optimization for spacecraft reentry simulation.

I have interned at [Space Applications Services](https://www.spaceapplications.com/) as an Avionics and Embedded Systems Engineer Intern, primarily working on Ground Support Equipment (GSE), and at [Redwire Space](https://redwirespace.com/), as a Mechanical Engineer Intern, contributing to on-orbit space servicing systems.

My research interests encompass everything that moves, real-time trajectory optimization, motion planning, and navigation for **high-performance autonomous systems**, on Earth and beyond.
